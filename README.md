## Description
We developed a platform to help farmers take care of themselves when the temperature is high, and they can provide data on their health so that different organizations can take action to help them with special programs or projects. It is important because farmers are a population at risk in the context of Global Warming. It is estimated that many of them are affected directly or indirectly by the long hours of exposure to the sun, many of them die because of it. However, governments do not take control because they do not have enough evidence to support the problem.
